Class-User-DBI

A User class: Login credentials and roles.

Through a DBIx::Connector object, this module models a "User" class, with
login credentials, and access roles.  Login credentials include a passphrase,
and optionally per user IP whitelisting.

The module is designed to simplify user logins, and basic administrative user
maintenance.  Passphrases are salted with a 512 bit random salt (unique per
user) using a cryptographically strong random number generator, and converted
to a SHA2-512 digest before being stored in the database.  All subsequent
passphrase validation checks test against the salt and passphrase SHA2 hash.

IP whitelists may be maintained per user.  If a user is set to require an IP
check, then the user validates only if his passphrase authenticates AND his
IP is found in the whitelist associated with his user id.

Users may be given a role, roles may have privileges.  Users may have multiple
"domains" (localities).  See the POD for the full documentation, and
./examples for an example script.
./scripts contains a database configuration script.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires List::MoreUtils, DBIx::Connector, and 
Authen::Passphrase::SaltedSHA512.

It also requires a database back-end.  The test suite will use DBD::SQLite,
but it has also been tested with DBD::mysql.  None of these dependencies could
be considered light-weight.  The dependency chain of this module is
indicative of the difficulty in assuring cryptographically strong random
salt generation, reliable SHA2-512 hashing of passphrases, fork-safe database
connectivity, and transactional commits for inserts and updates spanning
multiple tables. 

CONFIGURATION

The database needs seven tables.  They can be automatically generated by running
the configuration script provided in the ./scripts directory.

Please read the module's POD for a more thorough explanation and tips on 
configuring the database.
