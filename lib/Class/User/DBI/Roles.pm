=head1 NAME

Class::User::DBI::Roles - A Roles class.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01_001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Through a DBIx::Connector object, this module models a "Roles" class, used for
Roles Based Access Control.  Class::User::DBI allows each user to have a single
role.  Class::User::DBI::RolePrivileges allows each role to have multiple
privileges.  And so goes the heirarchy: A user has a role, and a role has
privileges.

    # Set up a connection using DBIx::Connector:
    # MySQL database settings:

    my $conn = DBIx::Connector->new(
        'dbi:mysql:database=cudbi_tests, 'testing_user', 'testers_pass',
        {
            RaiseError => 1,
            AutoCommit => 1,
        }
    );


    # Now we can play with Class::User::DBI::Roles

    # Set up a 'roles' table in the database.
    Class::User::DBI::Roles->configure_db( $conn );
    
    my $r = Class::User::DBI::Roles->new( $conn );

    $r->add_roles( 
        [ 'office', 'Office users'  ],
        [ 'admin',  'Administrator' ],
    );

    print "Role exists." if $r->exists_role( 'office' );

    my @roles = $r->fetch_roles;
    foreach my $role ( @roles ) {
        my( $name, $description ) = @{$role};
        print "$name => $description\n";
    }

    print "Description for 'office' role: ", 
          $r->get_role_description( 'office' );
    
    $r->set_role_description( 'office', 'Office staff' );
    
    $r->delete_roles( 'office' ); # Pass a list for multiple deletes.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a maintenance class facilitating the creation, deletion, and testing of
roles that are compatible with Class::User::DBI's roles, and 
Class::User::DBI::RolePrivileges roles.

A common usage is to configure a database table, and then add a few roles
along with their descriptions.  Think of roles as similar to Unix 'groups'.
Then use Class::User::DBI::Priviliges to create a few privileges.  Next use
Class::User::DBI::RolePrivileges to associate one or more privileges with a
given role.  Finally, use Class::User::DBI to associate a role with one or
more users.

=head1 EXPORT

Nothing is exported.  There are many object methods, and three class methods,
described in the next section.


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS


=head2  new
(The constructor -- Class method.)

    my $role_obj = Class::User::DBI::Roles->new( $connector );

Creates a role object that can be manipulated to set and get roles from the
database's 'cud_roles' table.  Pass a DBIx::Connector object as a parameter.  
Throws an exception if it doesn't get a valid DBIx::Connector.


=head2  configure_db
(Class method)

    Class::User::DBI::Roles->configure_db( $connector );

This is a class method.  Pass a valid DBIx::Connector as a parameter.  Builds
a minimal database table in support of the Class::User::DBI::Roles 
class.

The table created will be C<cud_roles>.

=head2 add_roles

    $r->add_roles( [ 'office', 'The office staff' ], ... );

Add one or more roles.  Each role must be bundled along with its description in
an array ref.  Pass an AoA for multiple roles, or just an aref for a single
role/description pair.

It will drop requests to add roles that already exist.

Returns a count of roles added, which may be less than the number passed if one
already existed.

=head2 delete_roles

    $r->delete_roles( 'office', 'sales' );

Deletes from the database all roles specified.  Return value is the number of
roles actually deleted, which may be less than the number of roles requested if
any of the requested roles didn't exist in the database to begin with.


=head2 exists_role

    print "Role exists." if $r->exists_role( 'office' );

Returns true if a given role exists, and false if not.

=head2 fetch_roles

    foreach my $role ( $r->fetch_roles ) {
        print "$_->[0] = $_->[1]\n";
    }
    
Returns an array of array refs.  Each array ref contains the role's name and its
description as the first and second elements, respectively.

An empty list means there are no roles defined.

=head2 get_role_description

    my $description = $r->get_role_description( 'office' );
    
Returns the description for a given role.  Throws an exception if the role 
doesn't exist, so be sure to test with C<< $r->exists_role( 'office' ) >> first.

=head2 set_role_description

    $r->set_role_description( 'office', 'New description for office role.' );

Sets a new description for a given role.  If the role doesn't exist in the
database, if not enough parameters are passed, or if any of the params are
C<undef>, an exception will be thrown.  To update a role by giving it a blank
description, pass an empty string as the description.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT



=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

If you find that your particular database engine is not playing nicely with the
test suite from this module, it may be necessary to provide the database login 
credentials for a test database using the same engine that your application 
will actually be using.  You may do this by setting C<$ENV{CUDBI_TEST_DSN}>,
C<$ENV{CUDBI_TEST_DATABASE}, C<$ENV{CUDBI_TEST_USER}>, 
and C<$ENV{CUDBI_TEST_PASS}>.

Currently the test suite tests against a SQLite database since it's such a
lightweight dependency for the testing.  The author also uses this module
with several MySQL databases.  As you're configuring your database, providing
its credentials to the tests and running the test scripts will offer really 
good diagnostics if some aspect of your database tables proves to be at odds 
with what this module needs.

Be advised that the the test suite drops its tables after completion, so be sure
to run the test suite only against a database set up explicitly for testing
purposes.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

This module has only been tested on MySQL and SQLite database engines.  If you
are successful in using it with other engines, please send me an email detailing
any additional configuration changes you had to make so that I can document
the compatibility, and improve the documentation for the configuration process.
