0.08 2012-11-02
  - "Changes" now CPAN::Changes::Spec compliant.
  - t/09-changes.t added to verify compliance.

0.07 2012-09-27
  - Eliminated some code that prevented running under pre-5.10 Perls (we

0.06 2012-08-30
  - Changed 'id' datatype to BIGINT in user_ips table to resolve issue where

    in unreliable round-trip.
